D2-Assignment
=============

In the "src/simplemd.cpp" file there is the implementation of the **linked cells**. Typing **make** produces
the serial version of the code, while typing **make parallel** produces the parallel version of the
code. The scalability of the code is reported in the **pdicerbo-P2.8/Plot** folder.
