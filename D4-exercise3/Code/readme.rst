D2-Code
=============

In the "src/simplemd.cpp" file there is the implementation of the **parallel tempering** algorithm.
Typing **make** produces the parallel version of the code. Moreover there is also **generate_input** script,
that allow to obtain a desired number of input files.
The relation between the mean energy of the system and the temperature is (obtained with the
**plot_mean_energy.py** python script) is reported in **pdicerbo-P2.8/Plot** folder.
